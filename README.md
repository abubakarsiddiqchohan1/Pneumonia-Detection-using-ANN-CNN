# Pneumonia-Detection-using-ANN-CNN
Hybrid Deep Learning project for Pneumonia Detection using both CNN &amp; ANN models having simple but interactive GUI deployed on Gradio. CNN model for classifying chest X-ray images, while ANN model trained for early(pre-pneumonia) detection. My university project in the "Deep Learning &amp; Neural Networks" course in my 5th semester of BS Data Science.
