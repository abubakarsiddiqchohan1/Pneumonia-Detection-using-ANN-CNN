 ðŸ“Œ Pneumonia Detection using ANN & CNN

ðŸ“– Description
This project was developed as part of my 5th semester university course *Deep Learning and Neural Networks*. The goal was to detect pneumonia using two different neural network architectures & deployed using Gradio:
- **ANN** for tabular pre-processed pneumonia data
- **CNN** for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images
- **Gradio** framework and GUI Library of Python for simple but interactive GUI

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Deep learning model architecture design using Keras & TensorFlow
- Training and evaluating ANN and CNN models
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Working with real medical datasets for classification tasks
- Handling overfitting using dropout, batch normalization, etc.

## ðŸ“Š Results
- **CNN Model Accuracy**: ~81.57% on validation set
- **ANN Model Accuracy**: ~95% on validation set
- **Loss Curves** and **Confusion Matrix** included in the notebook
- Comparison of ANN vs CNN performance
